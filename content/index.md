# Welcome to Quartz 4

Sep 20, 20242 min read

Quartz is a fast, batteries-included static-site generator that transforms Markdown content into fully functional websites. Thousands of students, developers, and teachers areÂ [already using Quartz](https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/showcase)Â to publish personal notes, websites, andÂ [digital gardens](https://jzhao.xyz/posts/networked-thought)Â to the web.

## ðŸª´ Get Started[](https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/#-get-started)

Quartz requiresÂ **at leastÂ [Node](https://nodejs.org/)Â v20**Â andÂ `npm`Â v9.3.1 to function correctly. Ensure you have this installed on your machine before continuing.

Then, in your terminal of choice, enter the following commands line by line:

`git clone https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz.gitcd quartznpm inpx quartz create`

This will guide you through initializing your Quartz with content. Once youâ€™ve done so, see how to:

1. [Writing content](https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/authoring-content)Â in Quartz
2. [Configure](https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/configuration)Â Quartzâ€™s behaviour
3. Change Quartzâ€™sÂ [layout](https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/layout)
4. [Build and preview](https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/build)Â Quartz
5. Sync your changes withÂ [GitHub](https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/setting-up-your-GitHub-repository)
6. [Host](https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/hosting)Â Quartz online

If you prefer instructions in a video format you can try following Nicole van der Hoevenâ€™sÂ [video guide on how to set up Quartz!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6s6DT1yN4dw&t=227s)
