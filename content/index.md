# [How to publish Obsidian notes with Quartz on GitHub Pages](https://notes.nicolevanderhoeven.com/How+to+publish+Obsidian+notes+with+Quartz+on+GitHub+Pages) 

On this page, I describe how I publish [Plain text](https://notes.nicolevanderhoeven.com/Plain+text) notes online using:

- [Obsidian](https://notes.nicolevanderhoeven.com/obsidian-playbook/Using+Obsidian/01+First+steps+with+Obsidian/Obsidian) as an interface to create and edit notes in [Markdown](https://notes.nicolevanderhoeven.com/obsidian-playbook/Using+Obsidian/02+Making+Notes+in+Obsidian/Markdown)
- [Quartz](https://notes.nicolevanderhoeven.com/Quartz) as a [Static site generator](https://notes.nicolevanderhoeven.com/Static+site+generator) to turn the Markdown into HTML
- [GitHub Pages](https://notes.nicolevanderhoeven.com/GitHub+Pages) as a hosting provider

This setup is free, with the exception of the last, optional, step. I'm also doing all of this on a [Mac](https://notes.nicolevanderhoeven.com/macOS). You may have to tailor terminal commands if you're using a different operating system.

Here's the end result: [Doing It in Public](https://doingitinpublic.com/). Now let's rewind and go through the steps to get there.

Much of this was taken from different pages of the [Quartz docs](https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/), but I'm reposting the steps to get this exact setup and combination of tools here.

Is this page I'm reading hosted on Quartz?
